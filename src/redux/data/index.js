                 "A Temporary Inconvenience will resonate with anyone who has had to leave their country and settle elsewhere. It is about memories of the life left behind. Told in some poignant and often harrowing poems, the first half of the book re-lives the pain of life under a brutal regime; remembering those raped, tortured or killed; images of a country in meltdown. The book reminds also that the grass is not always greener on the other side with pages of broken relationships, being lonely and homesick as well as the struggle to bring up children in a foreign country. The second half of the book gives a definitive portrait of a dictator and the impact he can have on the people he presides over regardless of whether they love or hate him. Living under a dictatorship may seem like a temporary inconvenience but that can last like forever. A Temporary Inconvenience takes you into a place the world sometimes pretends does not exist.",

                 "Hana Schank had never given much thought to her wedding, or even really imagined herself married, so when she found herself suddenly sporting a brand-new engagement ring she assumed planning a small, low-key wedding would be no big deal. But soon she finds herself adrift in Wedding Land, a world where all brides are expected to want to look like Cinderella, where women plan weddings with fantasy butterfly themes, where a woman's wedding is, without question, the Happiest Day of Her Life. Despite her best efforts not to become a Bridezilla, Hana finds herself transformed from a thirty-year-old woman with a 401(k) into a nearly unrecognizable version of herself as she spends weeks crafting save-the-date cards, worries about matching her cocktails to her wedding colors, and obsessively reads Martha Stewart Weddings magazine. She decides that, if she is going to follow traditions like wearing white and walking down the aisle with flowers, she at least wants to understand why. In her search she turns up interesting wedding facts: bridesmaids, for instance, were originally recruited to confuse evil spirits. Ultimately, she casts a critical eye on the $72 billion wedding industry, from the women at wedding websites who cackle over the etiquette missteps of others to wedding magazines that provide checklists of 187 tasks to plan the perfect wedding, suggesting that to have anything less is to fail as a bride, as a woman, as a wife. Part confessional memoir, part social critique, A More Perfect Union chronicles a year in Wedding Land, capturing as it does not only the stresses but the undoubted joys of becoming a bride.",

               description:
                 "A TRANSITION TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICS helps students make the transition from calculus to more proofs-oriented mathematical study. The most successful text of its kind, the 7th edition continues to provide a firm foundation in major concepts needed for continued study and guides students to think and express themselves mathematically to analyze a situation, extract pertinent facts, and draw appropriate conclusions. The authors place continuous emphasis throughout on improving students' ability to read and write proofs, and on developing their critical awareness for spotting common errors in proofs. Concepts are clearly explained and supported with detailed examples, while abundant and diverse exercises provide thorough practice on both routine and more challenging problems. Students will come away with a solid intuition for the types of mathematical reasoning they'll need to apply in later courses and a better understanding of how mathematicians of all kinds approach and solve problems.
